# SMS classifier project:


## Overview
This project aims to develop a text classification model to classify SMS messages as either spam or non-spam (ham). The model is built using data science techniques in Python.

## Dataset
The SMS Spam Collection dataset from Kaggle is used for this project. It contains a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) and save it as `sms_spam_collection.csv` in the project directory.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn

Install the required dependencies using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Implementation
1. Load and Explore the Dataset: Load the dataset using pandas and explore its structure and features.
2.Preprocess the Data: Preprocess the text data by removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, and tokenizing the text.
3.Split the Data : Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Train a Classifier : Train a classification model using algorithms like Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression.
5 Evaluate the Model : Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Fine-Tune the Model  (Optional): Experiment with different hyperparameters to improve the model's performance.
7. Deploy the Model (Optional): Deploy the model for real-world use, such as classifying SMS messages in production.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/sms-spam-classifier.git          cd sms-spam-classifier

2. Download the dataset from Kaggle and save it as `sms_spam_collection.csv` in the project directory.
3. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the `sms_classifier.py` script to train and evaluate the model:

python sms_classifier.py


## Results
Include the performance metrics and insights gained from evaluating the model.

## Future Improvements
List any potential improvements or enhancements that can be made to the model or the project.
